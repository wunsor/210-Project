# Winsor's Swim Meet Organizer 

## Project description

A swim meet organizer which will handle the organizational/ backend end of a swim meet. This application will allow someone to enter a list of swimmers and their events and then organize these swimmers into heats. This organization will be done based on their gender (so a separate male and female division), their best time (so that the fastest swimmers are in lane 4), and the type of race (the differing stroke/ event). A user interface would then be able to display this information in an organized matter. Moreover, a simple swimmer lookup function could be added to fetch information on what lane, what event, and what time a swimmer has. 

This application will be useful to both swimmers participating in a swim meet and the organizers of a swim meet. Oftentimes it is difficult for a swimmer at a swim meet to figure out what and when their events are in a quick way. In addition, for places without the funds or the scale to purchase other swim meet organizing applications, manually organizing swimmers into heats manually is really cumbersome. I have witnessed both of these issues through my experiences in competitive swimming, even seeing younger swimmers miss their races because they were unable to figure out when they were swimming! Therefore, this project is of interest to me because I want to address these two problems and create a more streamlined swim meet experience. 

A *bulleted* list:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a swimmer and their events, their time, and their gender (arbitrary X) to a list of participating swimmers (Y).
- As a user, I want to be able to organize the list of participating swimmers into heats based on their event, time, and gender.
- As a user, I want to be able to lookup my name to find my event and my lane.
